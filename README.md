Have you ever wanted to build a game without coding?  Now you can.

In this course, we'll cover the essentials of Bolt, Unity's official visual scripting solution:

 * Take a deep dive into the essentials of Flow Machines and Flow Graphs

 * Master the fundamentals of Bolt and visual scripting

 * Consolidate your graphs with SuperUnits

 * Create first-person movement logic, all without writing a single line of code

 * Build game mechanics in a modular, visual way

 * Learn by doing instead of watching. Each lecture incorporates exercises and challenges to engage the material.

Unity is a fantastic engine that enables you to make production-quality games. Build for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android all from a single project!

This course is designed for game developers of all levels who want to learn Unity's visual scripting tools.  Bolt is a visual framework around the UnityEngine API.  

If you're new to Unity, this is a great gateway into gameplay programming.  If you're an experienced developer, check out a fresh new take on traditional coding.  No matter your skill level, this is a fun way to dive into Unity.

At GameAcademy.school, we've trained tens of thousands of students in game development.  If you are a visual learner, there's no better time to get started in game development.

Unleash your creativity, and you'll be amazed at what you can build with Unity and Bolt!
